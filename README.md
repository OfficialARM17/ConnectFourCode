## Connect Four Game Code

Code for Connect Four Game that I made in Java

Code made in Intellij IDEA and meets the following requirements from the interview:
## Requirements
* Allow the player(s) to configure the size of the grid and the winning row length (i.e. A player could need 4, 5, or 3 tokens, etc. in a row to win the game)
* Initialise a new game grid.
* Add a token to the game grid. A token can be either Red or Yellow. A token is added to a specified grid column.
* Show the game grid state.
* Show the game grid state/progress in the console or log to a file.
* Show the next player to play, Red or Yellow.
* Show the winner.
* Allows the user to play again once the program has completed

## Programming Reasoning
I used Java to program this task as it is the language that I am the most familiar with and made the task easier to make. Moreover, the fact
that Java has the use of libraries such as Scanner and Collectors makes work so much easier.

## How to Run
No extra instructions are needed to run this code. Placing this code in an IDE and running the code will allow the system to full run as intended.
